// Use this file to list modules that currently don't have a type
// definition. It will serve as a temporary fix to the 'TS7016'
// error and as a list of the modules that need be updated and typed.
//
// Uncomment these lines to automatically load any module ending
// on '.jsx' or '.js' as of type 'Any'. You'll need to use the
// extension when importing the module. Not recommended but useful
// for development. For example:
//   import Label from "~/components/Label.jsx";
// declare module '*.jsx'
// declare module '*.js'
